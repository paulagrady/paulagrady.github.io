<h1>Be You and Enrich Your Life through Transitions</h1>
<p>
  Navigating everyday life can feel overwhelming whether you are going through major
life events such as loss of a loved one, separation, divorce, first or second marriages,
pre-retirement, employment changes or just feel lost in a fog of confusion about where
your life is going. If you desire the peace of mind that comes with knowing where you are
going and the confidence that you are on the path that is uniquely beneficial to you,
a lifestyle transition coach can help identify the goals that are right for you and help you
reach those goals.</p>
<p>
I’m Dan J. Kramer, and I can help you assess your current lifestyle and clarify your life’s
plans and dreams. I will help you create a step-by-step "Transition Plan" to reach your
future goals. This plan is unique to you - your needs, your goals and your current situation.</p>

<p>As a lifestyle transition coach, I am here to help you through the difficult times. My goal
is to help you live a healthier and happier life, and fulfill the dreams and goals that you set
for yourself.</p>

<p>I specialize in working with anyone going through a life transition by using the
"Aliveness Wheel" tool that I invented to describe the four dimensions of life:</>

 <p>Dimension 1: is the Now and Future Legacy Mission where you explore your life’s purpose.</p>

<p>Dimension 2: revolves around the Mind, Body and Spirit where you get to know your true
self, set goals and follow your passions.</p>

<p>Dimension 3: is Balance and Integration where you create a Life Action Plan,
manage your money and simplify your life.</p>

<p>Dimension 4: is planning for tomorrow using time management</p>
